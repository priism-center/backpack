An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA package which can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>. A comprehensive set of documented case studies, numerical accuracy/quality assurance exercises, and additional documentation are available from the 'abn' website.","Gilles Kratzer  [aut, cre],  Fraser Ian Lewis [aut],  Reinhard Furrer  [ctb],  Marta Pittavino  [ctb]",abn citation info,abn results,"nnet, Cairo, MASS, lme4, R (â‰¥ 2.15.1)","Bayesian, gR",GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],Gilles Kratzer  <gilles.kratzer at math.uzh.ch>,yes,8/10/18,1.2,"methods, rjags","Rcpp, RcppArmadillo",README ChangeLog,"INLA, Rgraphviz",Gnu Scientific Library version >= 1.12,http://www.r-bayesian-networks.org,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:473,AdMit,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AdMit/index.html,Provides functions to perform the fitting of an adaptive mixture of Student-t distributions to a target density through its kernel function as described in Ardia et al.

In this package, the CUDA programming model uses a separate thread for fitting a linear regression model at each voxel in parallel. The global statistical model implements a Gibbs Sampler for hierarchical linear models with a normal prior.

In addition, the package allows for flexibility in specifying parameters as either fixed (non-varying across individuals) or random with continuous distributions. Parameter distributions supported include normal, positive/negative log-normal, positive/negative censored normal, and the Johnson SB distribution.

The central algorithm is Fisher scoring and iterative reweighted least squares. At the heart of this package are the vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes.

The book ""Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R"" (Yee, 2015) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7> gives details of the statistical framework and the package. Currently only fixed-effects models are implemented. Many (150+) models and distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE.

The BOIN design is algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields an average performance that is comparable to that of the continual reassessment method (CRM, one of the best model-based designs) in terms of selecting the MTD, but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses.",Ying Yuan and Suyu Liu,NA,BOIN results,NA,ExperimentalDesign,GPL-2,Ying Yuan  <yyuan at mdanderson.org>,no,10/12/18,2.6.4,Iso,NA,NA,epade,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47381,BsMD,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BsMD/index.html,Bayes screening and model discrimination follow-up designs.,Ernesto Barrios based on Daniel Meyer's code.,NA,BsMD results,R (â‰¥ 2.14.0),ExperimentalDesign,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],ORPHANED,yes,2/1/18,2013.0718-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"daewr, FrF2",NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47382,choiceDes,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/choiceDes/index.html,Design functions for DCMs and other types of choice studies (including MaxDiff and other tradeoffs).,"Jack Horne [aut, cre]",NA,choiceDes results,"R (â‰¥ 2.15.2), AlgDesign",ExperimentalDesign,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],Jack Horne  <jack at jackhorne.net>,no,6/18/18,0.9-3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47383,CombinS,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CombinS/index.html,"Series of partially balanced incomplete block designs (PBIB) based on the combinatory method (S) introduced in (Imane Rezgui et al, 2014) <doi:10.3844/jmssp.2014.45.48>; and it gives their associated U-type design.","Mohamed Laib, Imane Rezgui, Zebida Gheribi-Aoulmi and Herve Monod",NA,CombinS results,NA,ExperimentalDesign,GPL-3,Mohamed Laib  <laib.med at gmail.com>,no,11/23/16,1.1-1,"stats, utils",NA,NA,NA,NA,'www.sites.google.com/site/mohamedlaibwebpage',NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47384,conf.design,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/conf.design/index.html,This small library contains a series of simple tools for constructing and manipulating confounded and fractional factorial designs.,Bill Venables,NA,conf.design results,NA,"ClinicalTrials, ExperimentalDesign",GPL-2,Bill Venables  <Bill.Venables at gmail.com>,no,2/23/13,2.0.0,NA,NA,NA,"stats, utils",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,DoE.base,"muHVT, planor, sensors4plumes, sFFLHD",rsm,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47385,crmPack,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crmPack/index.html,"Implements a wide range of model-based dose escalation designs, ranging from classical and modern continual reassessment methods (CRMs) based on dose-limiting toxicity endpoints to dual-endpoint designs taking into account a biomarker/efficacy outcome.

The term elemental derives from the fact that each function is aimed at construction of graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental questions that drive the particular anova methods. The two main functions are granova.1w (a graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These functions were written to display data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes (however, very large data sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For these two functions a specialized approach is used to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are displayed. The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and when appropriate flat surfaces, to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect tests in anova. The graphic results are complementary to standard summary tables for these two basic kinds of analysis of variance; numerical summary results of analyses are also provided as side effects. Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples), and granova.contr (which provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data. The graphics based on these functions should be especially helpful for learning how the methods have been applied to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be particularly helpful for students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods should be quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as they can help to identify outliers, clusters or patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear transformations of data. In the case of granova.1w and granova.ds especially, several arguments are provided to facilitate flexibility in the construction of graphics that accommodate diverse features of data, according to their corresponding display requirements.

The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing the durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring of each treatment group for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and high efficacy is warranted. The design divides the trial into two stages of time periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first stage of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage two. The package produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics of a specified design including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the different possible trial monitoring outcomes (e.g., stopping early for non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacies; and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the design of studies of the association of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate endpoint problem).

For example 'quad' allows efficient storage of genomic data as an 'A','T','G','C' factor. The unsigned types support 'circular' arithmetic. There is also support for close-to-atomic types 'factor', 'ordered', 'POSIXct', 'Date' and custom close-to-atomic types. ff not only has native C-support for vectors, matrices and arrays with flexible dimorder (major column-order, major row-order and generalizations for arrays). There is also a ffdf class not unlike data.frames and import/export filters for csv files. ff objects store raw data in binary flat files in native encoding, and complement this with metadata stored in R as physical and virtual attributes. ff objects have well-defined hybrid copying semantics, which gives rise to certain performance improvements through virtualization. ff objects can be stored and reopened across R sessions. ff files can be shared by multiple ff R objects (using different data en/de-coding schemes) in the same process or from multiple R processes to exploit parallelism. A wide choice of finalizer options allows to work with 'permanent' files as well as creating/removing 'temporary' ff files completely transparent to the user. On certain OS/Filesystem combinations, creating the ff files works without notable delay thanks to using sparse file allocation. Several access optimization techniques such as Hybrid Index Preprocessing and Virtualization are implemented to achieve good performance even with large datasets, for example virtual matrix transpose without touching a single byte on disk. Further, to reduce disk I/O, 'logicals' and non-standard data types get stored native and compact on binary flat files i.e. logicals take up exactly 2 bits to represent TRUE, FALSE and NA. Beyond basic access functions, the ff package also provides compatibility functions that facilitate writing code for ff and ram objects and support for batch processing on ff objects (e.g. as.ram, as.ff, ffapply). ff interfaces closely with functionality from package 'bit': chunked looping, fast bit operations and coercions between different objects that can store subscript information ('bit', 'bitwhich', ff 'boolean', ri range index, hi hybrid index). This allows to work interactively with selections of large datasets and quickly modify selection criteria. Further high-performance enhancements can be made available upon request.","Daniel Adler, 	Christian GlÃƒÂ_ser,	Oleg Nenadic, 	Jens OehlschlÃƒÂ_gel,	Walter Zucchini",NA,ff results,"R (â‰¥ 2.10.1), bit (â‰¥ 1.1-13), utils",HighPerformanceComputing,GPL-2 | file LICENSE,Jens OehlschlÃƒÂ_gel  <Jens.Oehlschlaegel at truecluster.com>,yes,5/15/18,2.2-14,NA,NA,NEWS,biglm,NA,http://ff.r-forge.r-project.org/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BayesSummaryStatLM, biglars, ETLUtils, ffbase, PopGenome, propagate, RecordLinkage, tabplot","BGData, bigchess, bootSVD, Cyclops, DatabaseConnector, Haplin, IsoGene, rmgarch, Rnightlights, SFtools, SpaDES.tools, Stack, symDMatrix","credsubs, Hmisc, LinkedMatrix, nat.nblast, RMOA",NA,prediction,10/14/18 15:47548,ffbase,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ffbase/index.html,Extends the out of memory vectors of 'ff' with statistical functions and other utilities to ease their usage.,"Edwin de Jonge, Jan Wijffels, Jan van der Laan",NA,ffbase results,"R (â‰¥ 2.12.0), ff (â‰¥ 2.2-11)",HighPerformanceComputing,GPL-3,Edwin de Jonge  <edwindjonge at gmail.com>,yes,9/24/18,0.12.5,"fastmatch, bit",NA,NEWS,"testthat, parallel, LaF, biglm",NA,http://github.com/edwindj/ffbase,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RecordLinkage, tabplot","bigchess, Cyclops, DatabaseConnector, Haplin, Rnightlights, SpaDES.tools, Stack",Hmisc,NA,prediction,10/14/18 15:47549,flowr,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flowr/index.html,"This framework allows you to design and implement complex pipelines, and deploy them on your institution's computing cluster.

parallel processing of R expression via futures. The simplest way to evaluate an expression in parallel is to use 'x %<-% { expression }' with 'plan(multiprocess)'. This package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and cluster futures. With these, R expressions can be evaluated on the local machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed on a mix of local and remote machines. Extensions to this package implement additional backends for processing futures via compute cluster schedulers etc. Because of its unified API, there is no need to modify any code in order switch from sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed processing on a remote compute cluster. Another strength of this package is that global variables and functions are automatically identified and exported as needed, making it straightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures.","Henrik Bengtsson [aut, cre, cph]",NA,future results,NA,HighPerformanceComputing,LGPL-2.1 | LGPL-3 [expanded from: LGPL (â‰¥ 2.1)],Henrik Bengtsson  <henrikb at braju.com>,no,7/23/18,1.9.0,"digest, globals (â‰¥ 0.12.0), listenv (â‰¥ 0.7.0), parallel, utils",NA,NEWS,"R.rsp, markdown",NA,https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future,https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"doFuture, furrr, future.apply, future.BatchJobs, future.batchtools, future.callr, pbmcapply","aroma.affymetrix, aroma.core, civis, codebook, drake, drtmle, fiery, googleComputeEngineR, kernelboot, lidR, MetamapsDB, origami, PSCBS, robotstxt, RTransferEntropy, skpr, sperrorest, startR, vinereg","BAMBI, batchtools, brms, ipc, jstor, penaltyLearning, promises, R.filesets, reproducible",NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47552,future.BatchJobs,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future.BatchJobs/index.html,"Implementation of the Future API on top of the 'BatchJobs' package.

Nowadays, there exists a wide variety of algorithms to generate fuzzy IF-THEN rules automatically from numerical data, covering both steps. Approaches that have been used in the past are, e.g., heuristic procedures, neuro-fuzzy techniques, clustering methods, genetic algorithms, squares methods, etc. Furthermore, in this version we provide a universal framework named 'frbsPMML', which is adopted from the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), for representing FRBS models. PMML is an XML-based language to provide a standard for describing models produced by data mining and machine learning algorithms. Therefore, we are allowed to export and import an FRBS model to/from 'frbsPMML'. Finally, this package aims to implement the most widely used standard procedures, thus offering a standard package for FRBS modeling to the R community.","Lala Septem Riza, Christoph Bergmeir, Francisco Herrera, and    Jose Manuel Benitez",frbs citation info,frbs results,NA,MachineLearning,GPL-2 | GPL-3 | file LICENSE [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2) | file LICENSE],Christoph Bergmeir  <c.bergmeir at decsai.ugr.es>,no,5/22/15,3.1-0,NA,NA,NA,"class, e1071, XML",NA,http://sci2s.ugr.es/dicits/software/FRBS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,exprso,mlr,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47634,gamboostLSS,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamboostLSS/index.html,"Boosting models for fitting generalized additive models for location, shape and scale ('GAMLSS') to potentially high dimensional data.","Benjamin Hofner  [aut, cre],  Andreas Mayr [aut],  Nora Fenske [aut],  Janek Thomas [aut],  Matthias Schmid [aut]",gamboostLSS citation info,gamboostLSS results,"R (â‰¥ 2.10.0), mboost (â‰¥ 2.8-0), stabs (â‰¥ 0.5-0), parallel",MachineLearning,GPL-2,Benjamin Hofner  <benjamin.hofner at pei.de>,no,6/15/18,2.0-1,"graphics, grDevices, stats, utils",NA,README NEWS ChangeLog,"gamlss, gamlss.dist, survival, BayesX, R2BayesX",NA,"For source code, development versions and issue tracker seehttps://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,betaboost,FDboost,stabs,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47635,gbm,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html,"An implementation of extensions to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting machine.

This can be saved as a standalone R script file and as an aid for the user to learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into R itself.","Graham Williams [aut, cph, cre],  Mark Vere Culp [cph],  Ed Cox [ctb],  Anthony Nolan [ctb],  Denis White [cph],  Daniele Medri [ctb],  Akbar Waljee [ctb] (OOB AUC for Random Forest),  Brian Ripley [cph] (print.summary.nnet),  Jose Magana [ctb] (ggpairs plots),  Surendra Tipparaju [ctb] (initial RevoScaleR/XDF),  Durga Prasad Chappidi [ctb] (initial RevoScaleR/XDF),  Dinesh Manyam Venkata [ctb] (initial RevoScaleR/XDF),  Mrinal Chakraborty [ctb] (initial RevoScaleR/XDF),  Fang Zhou [ctb] (initial xgboost),  Cameron Chisholm [ctb] (risk plot on risk chart)",rattle citation info,rattle results,R (â‰¥ 2.13.0),"MachineLearning, ModelDeployment",GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],Graham Williams  <Graham.Williams at togaware.com>,no,8/17/18,5.2.0,"stats, utils, ggplot2, grDevices, graphics, magrittr, methods, stringi, stringr, tidyr, dplyr, XML, rpart.plot",NA,NEWS,"pmml (â‰¥ 1.2.13), bitops, colorspace, ada, amap, arules, arulesViz, biclust, cairoDevice, cba, cluster, corrplot, descr, doBy, e1071, ellipse, fBasics, foreign, fpc, gdata, ggdendro, ggraptR, gplots, grid, gridExtra, gtools, gWidgetsRGtk2, hmeasure, Hmisc, kernlab, Matrix, mice, nnet, party, playwith, plyr, psych, randomForest, rattle.data, RColorBrewer, readxl, reshape, rggobi, RGtk2, ROCR, RODBC, rpart, scales, SnowballC, survival, timeDate, tm, verification, wskm, RGtk2Extras, xgboost",NA,https://rattle.togaware.com/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,mvc,MetabolomicsBasics,rattle.data,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47675,RcppDL,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppDL/index.html,"This package is based on the C++ code from Yusuke Sugomori, which implements basic machine learning methods with many layers (deep learning), including dA (Denoising Autoencoder), SdA (Stacked Denoising Autoencoder), RBM (Restricted Boltzmann machine) and DBN (Deep Belief Nets).","Qiang Kou, Yusuke Sugomori",NA,RcppDL results,NA,MachineLearning,GPL-3,Qiang Kou  <qkou at umail.iu.edu>,yes,12/17/14,0.0.5,"methods, Rcpp (â‰¥ 0.11.2)",Rcpp,NA,NA,NA,https://github.com/thirdwing/RcppDL,https://github.com/thirdwing/RcppDL/issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47676,rdetools,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdetools/index.html,"The package provides functions for estimating the relevant dimension of a data set in feature spaces, applications to model selection, graphical illustrations and prediction.",Jan Saputra Mueller,NA,rdetools results,NA,MachineLearning,GPL-2,Jan Saputra Mueller  <saputra at cs.tu-berlin.de>,no,10/29/12,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47677,REEMtree,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REEMtree/index.html,This package estimates regression trees with random effects as a way to use data mining techniques to describe longitudinal or panel data.,Rebecca Sela and Jeffrey Simonoff,REEMtree citation info,REEMtree results,"nlme, rpart, methods",MachineLearning,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL],Rebecca Sela  <rsela at stern.nyu.edu>,no,8/8/11,0.90.3,NA,NA,NA,AER,NA,http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jsimonof/REEMtree/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47678,relaxo,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/relaxo/index.html,"Relaxed Lasso is a generalisation of the Lasso shrinkage technique for linear regression.

Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching mechanism.

Network meta-analyses and meta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g., due to phylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted.","Wolfgang Viechtbauer [aut, cre]",metafor citation info,metafor results,"R (â‰¥ 3.2.0), methods, Matrix","ClinicalTrials, MetaAnalysis, Phylogenetics",GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],Wolfgang Viechtbauer  <wvb at metafor-project.org>,no,6/22/17,2.0-0,"stats, utils, graphics, grDevices, nlme",NA,README NEWS,"lme4, numDeriv, minqa, nloptr, dfoptim, ucminf, CompQuadForm, mvtnorm, Formula, R.rsp, testthat, BiasedUrn, survival, Epi, multcomp, gsl, boot, MASS",NA,"http://www.metafor-project.org https://github.com/wviechtb/metaforhttp://www.wvbauer.com",https://github.com/wviechtb/metafor/issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"bayesmeta, hetmeta, MCPerm, metaforest, SAMURAI","catmap, ConfoundedMeta, eefAnalytics, EValue, fmri, getmstatistic, KenSyn, MAVIS, metagear, metagen, metamedian, metamisc, metaplus, metaviz, NSM3, psychmeta, puniform, RcmdrPlugin.MA, Replicate, reproducer, rma.exact, SimTimeVar, SSDforR, xmeta","agridat, clubSandwich, forestmodel, MAc, MAd, meta, metansue, metaplotr, metaSEM, mvmeta",NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47743,metaforest,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaforest/index.html,"Conduct random forests-based meta-analysis, obtain partial dependence plots for metaforest and classic meta-analyses, and cross-validate and tune metaforest- and classic meta-analyses in conjunction with the caret package.

However, in many fields, there is substantial heterogeneity between studies on the same topic. Classic meta-analysis lacks the power to assess more than a handful of univariate moderators. MetaForest, by contrast, has substantial power to explore heterogeneity in meta-analysis. It can identify important moderators from a larger set of potential candidates, even with as little as 20 studies (Van Lissa, in preparation).

Excess in the observed number of positive studies, compared to the expected, is taken as evidence of publication bias. The observed number of positive studies, at a given level for statistical significance, is calculated by applying Fisher's exact test to the reported 2x2 table data of each constituent study, doubling the Fisher one-sided P-value to make a two-sided test. The corresponding expected number of positive studies was obtained by summing the statistical powers of each study. The statistical power depended on a given measure of effect which, here, was the pooled odds ratio of the meta-analysis was used. By simulating each constituent study, with the given odds ratio, and the same number of treated and non-treated as in the real study, the power of the study is estimated as the proportion of simulated studies that are positive, again by a Fisher's exact test. The simulated number of events in the treated and untreated groups was done with binomial sampling. In the untreated group, the binomial proportion was the percentage of actual events reported in the study and, in the treated group, the binomial sampling proportion was the untreated percentage multiplied by the risk ratio which was derived from the assumed common odds ratio. The statistical significance for judging a positive study may be varied and large differences between expected and observed number of positive studies around the level of 0.05 significance constitutes evidence of publication bias. The difference between the observed and expected is tested by chi-square. A chi-square test P-value for the difference below 0.05 is suggestive of publication bias, however, a less stringent level of 0.1 is often used in studies of publication bias as the number of published studies is usually small.",Simon Thornley,NA,PubBias results,"rmeta, R.utils",MetaAnalysis,GPL-3,Simon Thornley  <sithor at gmail.com>,no,11/21/13,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:47781,puniform,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/puniform/index.html,"Provides meta-analysis methods that correct for publication bias.

The p-uniform method as described in van Assen, van Aert, and Wicherts (2015) <doi:10.1037/met0000025> can be used for estimating the average effect size, testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias using only the statistically significant effect sizes of primary studies.

This method is an extension of the p-uniform method that allows for estimation of the average effect size and the between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and uses both the statistically significant and nonsignificant effect sizes. The third method in the package is the hybrid method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2017) <doi:10.3758/s13428-017-0967-6>. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method for combining an original study and replication and while taking into account statistical significance of the original study. The p-uniform and hybrid method are based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. The fourth method in the package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175302>. This method computes posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium, and large) based on an original study and replication while taking into account publication bias in the original study.

One way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distributions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparametric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear & Begg (1992). The new approach potentially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear & Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).",Kaspar Rufibach,NA,selectMeta results,DEoptim (â‰¥ 2.0-6),MetaAnalysis,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],Kaspar Rufibach  <kaspar.rufibach at gmail.com>,no,7/3/15,1.0.8,"graphics, stats",NA,NEWS,NA,NA,http://www.kasparrufibach.ch,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:48794,seqMeta,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seqMeta/index.html,"Computes necessary information to meta analyze region-based tests for rare genetic variants (e.g. SKAT, T1) in individual studies, and performs meta analysis.","Arie Voorman, Jennifer Brody, Han Chen, Thomas Lumley, Brian Davis",NA,seqMeta results,"R (â‰¥ 3.1.0), methods, survival",MetaAnalysis,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],Brian Davis  <Brian.Davis281 at gmail.com>,yes,2/9/17,1.6.7,"Matrix, coxme (â‰¥ 2.2-4), CompQuadForm",NA,README NEWS,"SKAT, kinship2, testthat",NA,https://github.com/DavisBrian/seqMeta,https://github.com/DavisBrian/seqMeta/issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:48795,TFisher,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TFisher/index.html,"We provide the cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, and statistical power calculator for a collection of thresholding Fisher's p-value combination methods, including Fisher's p-value combination method, truncated product method and, in particular, soft-thresholding Fisher's p-value combination method which is proven to be optimal in some context of signal detection.

Generally, communities are sampled from subpopulations (strata) in a first stage, and then households are listed and sampled in a second stage. In this typical two-stage design, sampled communities are the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and households are the Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). Census data typically serve as the sample frame from which PSUs are selected. However, if census data are outdated inaccurate, or too geographically course, gridded population data (such as <http://www.worldpop.org.uk>) can be used as a sample frame instead. GridSample (<doi:10.1186/s12942-017-0098-4>) generates PSUs from gridded population data according to user-specified complex survey design characteristics and household sample size. In gridded population sampling, like census sampling, PSUs are selected within each stratum using a serpentine sampling method, and can be oversampled in urban or rural areas to ensure a minimum sample size in each of these important sub-domains. Furthermore, because grid cells are uniform in size and shape, gridded population sampling allows for samples to be representative of both the population and of space, which is not possible with a census sample frame.","Dana R.

Principle 1 determines all sensible univariate relationships in the spirit of the Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of variables, including predictors and the final outcome variable, is determined with the Markovian property that the value of the current predictor is sufficient in relating to the next level variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific value of the preceding-level variables to the current predictor, given the current value. Principle 2 resembles the multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship of the first-level predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc) to the outcome variable (such as, module degradation or yellowing) is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each significant intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome variable and the other variables (except the final outcome variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This fitting process is continued until all sensible models are investigated.","Junheng Ma, Nicholas Wheeler, Yifan Xu, Wenyu Du, Abdulkerim Gok, Jiayang Sun",NA,gSEM results,R (â‰¥ 2.14.0),Psychometrics,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],Junheng Ma  <jxm216 at case.edu>,no,1/11/16,0.4.3.4,"knitr, MASS, htmlwidgets, DiagrammeR",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:471018,gtheory,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtheory/index.html,"Estimates variance components, generalizability coefficients, universe scores, and standard errors when observed scores contain variation from one or more measurement facets (e.g., items and raters).","Christopher T.

Only those packages are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any time.

Functions rstring() and rcat() make it easy to process RSP strings, rsource() sources an RSP file as it was an R script, while rfile() compiles it (even online) into its final output format, e.g. rfile('report.tex.rsp') generates 'report.pdf' and rfile('report.md.rsp') generates 'report.html'.

Spatial weights are derived by a Kernel function from a user-defined matrix of distances between contextual units. Spatial weights can then be applied either to precise contextual measures or to aggregate estimates based on micro-level survey data, to compute spatially weighted context data. Available aggregation functions include indicators of central tendency, dispersion, or inter-group variability, and take into account survey design weights. The package further allows combining the resulting spatially weighted context data with individual-level predictor and outcome variables, for the purposes of multilevel modelling. An ad hoc stratified bootstrap resampling procedure generates robust point estimates for multilevel regression coefficients and model fit indicators, and computes confidence intervals adjusted for measurement dependency and measurement error of aggregate estimates.

Focused mainly on two-dimensional point patterns, including multitype/marked points, in any spatial region. Also supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-time point patterns in any number of dimensions, point patterns on a linear network, and patterns of other geometrical objects. Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel images. Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference. Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and linear networks. Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported. Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above. Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.","Adrian Baddeley,	Rolf Turner         and Ege Rubak,	with substantial contributions of code by 	Kasper Klitgaard Berthelsen;	Ottmar Cronie;	Yongtao Guan;	Ute Hahn;	Abdollah Jalilian;	Marie-Colette van Lieshout;	Greg McSwiggan;	Tuomas Rajala;	Suman Rakshit;	Dominic Schuhmacher;	Rasmus Waagepetersen; 	and Hangsheng Wang.	Additional contributions 	by M.

A Gaussian process in space and time is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process. In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous. This package aims at providing tools for two different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero. Covariates can be included in the model through a regression term.","Fabio Sigrist, Hans R.

It is well known that in a cointegrating regression the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the parameters is super-consistent, i.e. converges at rate equal to the sample size T. When the regressors are endogenous, the limiting distribution of the OLS estimator is contaminated by so-called second order bias terms, see e.g. Phillips and Hansen (1990) <doi:10.2307/2297545>. The presence of these bias terms renders inference difficult. Consequently, several modifications to OLS that lead to zero mean Gaussian mixture limiting distributions have been proposed, which in turn make standard asymptotic inference feasible. These methods include the fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) approach of Phillips and Hansen (1990) <doi:10.2307/2297545>, the dynamic OLS (D-OLS) approach of Phillips and Loretan (1991) <doi:10.2307/2298004>, Saikkonen (1991) <doi:10.1017/S0266466600004217> and Stock and Watson (1993) <doi:10.2307/2951763> and the new estimation approach called integrated modified OLS (IM-OLS) of Vogelsang and Wagner (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.10.015>. The latter is based on an augmented partial sum (integration) transformation of the regression model. IM-OLS is similar in spirit to the FM- and D-OLS approaches, with the key difference that it does not require estimation of long run variance matrices and avoids the need to choose tuning parameters (kernels, bandwidths, lags). However, inference does require that a long run variance be scaled out. This package provides functions for the parameter estimation and inference with all three modified OLS approaches. That includes the automatic bandwidth selection approaches of Andrews (1991) <doi:10.2307/2938229> and of Newey and West (1994) <doi:10.2307/2297912> as well as the calculation of the long run variance.","Philipp Aschersleben [aut, cre],  Martin Wagner [aut] (Author of underlying MATLAB code.)",NA,cointReg results,NA,TimeSeries,GPL-3,Philipp Aschersleben  <aschersleben at statistik.tu-dortmund.de>,no,6/14/16,0.2.0,"checkmate (â‰¥ 1.6.0), MASS, matrixStats (â‰¥ 0.14.1)",NA,README NEWS,"testthat, knitr, rmarkdown",NA,https://github.com/aschersleben/cointReg,https://github.com/aschersleben/cointReg/issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,cointmonitoR,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:471449,CommonTrend,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CommonTrend/index.html,"Directly extract and plot stochastic common trends from a cointegration system using different approaches, currently including Kasa (1992) and Gonzalo and Granger (1995).

Many such data sets are noisy, multivariate, and multi-subject in nature.

The package 'dynr' (Dynamic Modeling in R) is an R package that implements a set of computationally efficient algorithms for handling a broad class of linear and nonlinear discrete- and continuous-time models with regime-switching properties under the constraint of linear Gaussian measurement functions. The discrete-time models can generally take on the form of a state- space or difference equation model. The continuous-time models are generally expressed as a set of ordinary or stochastic differential equations. All estimation and computations are performed in C, but users are provided with the option to specify the model of interest via a set of simple and easy-to-learn model specification functions in R. Model fitting can be performed using single- subject time series data or multiple-subject longitudinal data.","Lu Ou [aut],  Michael D.

For model specification, the package performs structural specification to overcome the difficulties of identifiability of VARMA models. The methods used for structural specification include Kronecker indices and Scalar Component Models. (b) For multivariate volatility modeling, the MTS package handles several commonly used models, including multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average volatility, Cholesky decomposition volatility models, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models, copula-based volatility models, and low-dimensional BEKK models. The package also considers multiple tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, including rank-based statistics. (c) Finally, the MTS package also performs forecasting using diffusion index, transfer function analysis, Bayesian estimation of VAR models, and multivariate time series analysis with missing values.Users can also use the package to simulate VARMA models, to compute impulse response functions of a fitted VARMA model, and to calculate theoretical cross-covariance matrices of a given VARMA model.",Ruey S.

Besides, the package contains some miscellaneous functions to compute density, distribution, quantile, and generate random numbers from ZIP and ZINB distributions.","Ming Yang [aut, cre],  Gideon Zamba [aut],  Joseph Cavanaugh [aut]",NA,ZIM results,NA,TimeSeries,GPL-3,Ming Yang  <mingyang at biostatstudio.com>,no,8/28/18,1.1.0,MASS,NA,README,"pscl, TSA",NA,https://github.com/biostatstudio/ZIM,https://github.com/biostatstudio/ZIM/issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,equSA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:481656,ZRA,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ZRA/index.html,"Combines a forecast of a time series, using the function forecast(), with the dynamic plots from dygraphs.",David Beiner,NA,ZRA results,"R (â‰¥ 3.0.2), forecast, dygraphs, stats",TimeSeries,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (â‰¥ 2)],David Beiner  <zra.r.package at gmail.com>,no,8/31/15,0.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10/14/18 15:48
